## FSA 1809 Stackathon Project

## -By Richard Dominguez

### A simple implementation of the classic table top game developed for Android with React-Native over 3.5 days

(I've never used React-Native prior to this project)

- Ongoing development. Check in from time to time to see whats new!
- Originated in England in 1880’s
- Othello is a marketing name for a simplified, western version of GO :

#### **_Basic Rules:_**

- Players must make “lines” composed of their own pieces on the ends, surrounding opponent pieces.
- All surrounded opponent pieces “flip” over
- When board is full, player with more pieces wins

---

## **_Desired Features:_**

- User starts app, lands on welcome page where login/sign up occurs.
- User signs in and game history/states and scores are tracked.
- User should be able to chat to other players in a lobby and challenge players to a game there
- Users should also be able to play against an ai or or local, human players via hot seat mode.
- Games should feature full Reversi game play capability.
- Games should feature an undo and new game buttons, track valid moves.
- Games should track user score and current player

---

#### **_Minimum Viable Product:_**

- A fully working basic game client.
- Game must be able to reach end game conditions via two player hot seat mode with crashing or glitching(most of the time).

## **_Lessons Learned:_**

- Getting properly set up when first using a new environment/language/tool set is vitally important. This was the first time I had to jump into a new tool set (Android Studio and SDK) and get set up without a handy FSA guide.
- A large part of my initial project time was taken up by getting properly set up and debugging connection errors and installing missing software.
- More learned about Ubuntu OS in specific and Linux in general. I’m working entirely off a notebook running Ubuntu 18.04 and most guides I found for the issues I encountered were written for Mac or Windows users. I learned more about Linux by having to dig a little deeper than before.
- Not to make too many, or any, assumptions about the similarities across environments or languages, even related ones.
- React and React-Native are in the same family and share a lot of the same characteristics, but have some key differences
  I kept writing <div> and <li> / <ul> and so on at first, out of habit

#### **_Takeaways:_**

- Learning a new technology is easier once you’ve learned a similar language, just like with spoken language.
- Spending the time to fully complete and follow several online tutorials (perhaps paid ones) when setting a new dev environment is worth the cost and time, even with a deadline!
